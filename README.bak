Hi!

TypoFlash is an ActionScript framework to make Typo3 a Flash CMS developed by Andreas Borg, between 2005-2009. It is made up of
1. two backend extensions
2. AS2 and AS3 (Flash player version 9) codebase
3. initial GUI framework for Flash frontend editing 

The framework is not finished, but I am currently more interested in working with digital installations and physical interactivity than waiting for websites to load. I am releasing the code since I spent years refining it and a lot of though and planning went into the project. I hope it can continue to grow. I am releasing it since I get frequent requests about TypoFlash and it would be a shame for it to go waste. However, this stuff may not work out of the box because what I have done is gathered bits and pieces from my harddrive and not really tested it for a while. Having said that, the main reason the framework would break is if typo3 database structure has changed, but that has not happened for a few years. So here is a very short and rough guide how to get up and running.

1. Upload and install extensions

Flash remoting  		flashremoting  	0.8.0
TypoFlash			typoflash  	1.0.0

Optional
TemplaVoila!  			templavoila  	1.3.4
News				tt_news		2.5.2
Media (DAM) for TypoFlash  	dam  	1.1.1b

I have had quick some issues with static tables as well so have supplied a version that I think works



2. Make a simple TemplaVoila template for the HTML alternative
eg.

<html>
<head>
<title>Template</title>

<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/stylesheet.css" type="text/css">
<script language="JavaScript1.1" src="js/common.js"></script>
</head>
<body leftmargin="0" topmargin="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0">

<div id="html_alternative">
   <div id="menu"></div>
   <div id="categories"></div>
   <div id="content"></div>
   <div id="footer"></div>
</div>
<div id="flash"></div>

</body>
</html>

You can make your template however you want, but the id of the tag for the fullpage swf is important for your TS setup template, as well as the tag where the swf object javascript will go. To save yourself some headache just use "html_alternative" and map the flash div to TypoScript Object path lib.flash (see templavoila.jpg). 
 
3. Build your pagetree and make a root, and storage folder
In the storage folder create a Flash Template. (See image flashtemplate.settings.jpg). You can leave most of the fields empty. Some are legacy and only relevant for some Flash versions. Since you haven't built the actual template any Flash file will do for the moment.

4. In your typo3 page tree, edit page properties on the root page where you would normally set the TemplaVoila template. Now there is also a Flash template option where your template should appear. You will only need to set it for the root page. You can have different templates for subpages, which reloads the whole site, but I haven't really used it since I enabled it.

5. Create your typoscript template on the root page.
I have supplied a dummy one.
Important bits are
config.linkVars = flash

yoururls.com?flash=0 will bring up normal html site

Inlcude the TypoFlash setup exmaple (see includes.jpg)

Check out the typoflash/static/setup.txt

I will explain the whole structure as soon as I get a moment but for now check out http://haveathink.net for the result.

If you find this useful and make contributions please let me know and happy githubbing!!

Peace and love!
